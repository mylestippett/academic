I am a keen digital marketer with more than 12 years experience working on inbound marketing in different industries. With vast experience in ecommerce, SEO and email marketing channels, I currently focus on subscription marketing with user journeys, experience and retention in mind. I'm particularly interested in conversion optimisation, personalisation and implementing best practices in all inbound marketing.
